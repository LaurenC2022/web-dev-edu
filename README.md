See this repository as a website [here](https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/). 

The purpose of posting educational assignments in a repository is to reference code snippets and completed projects i have done. I expect this repo will help with recall when I am stuck on a simple project or want to quickly remember how code renders on a browser.

### Book 2: Coding the Front End, Part 1: HTML & CSS
#### Chaper 3: Sizing and Positioning Page Elements 
1. Learning About the CSS Box Model: [Link to My Playground](https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/web-coding-and-development-by-paul-mcfedries/book-two-coding-front-end-p1/ch3-sizing-and-positioning-page-elements/1-pg104-learning-about-the-css-box-model.html)

    - Padding: space around the content within the box
    - Margin: Space outside of the border seperating the box from other boxes 
    - border: surrounding the box padding and content
 
2. Styling Element Sizes: [Link to My Playground](https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/web-coding-and-development-by-paul-mcfedries/book-two-coding-front-end-p1/ch3-sizing-and-positioning-page-elements/2-pg105-styling-element-sizes.html)
 
    - Block-level elements (ex: header, div) have width of their parent element. Body element width is set to browser's content area 
    - Block element's size is content only, excludes padding, boarders and margins
    - [**Box-sizing: border-box**](https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/web-coding-and-development-by-paul-mcfedries/book-two-coding-front-end-p1/ch3-sizing-and-positioning-page-elements/my-playgrounds/1-box-sizing-my-playground.html) is a CSS property which redefines element's size to include padding, and border 
    - Best practice: set width and heights for all box elements, so nothing is left up to chance and website always looks the way it is designed
    - inline element can be made to behave like a block element
        - Method 1 with CSS: 
            - dispay: inline-block; 
            - gives inline element block related properties, but still is inline 
        - Method 2 with CSS: 
            - display: block; 
            - turns inline elements into block elements, inline element will behave exactly like a box element 

3. Adding Padding: [Link to My Playground](https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/web-coding-and-development-by-paul-mcfedries/book-two-coding-front-end-p1/ch3-sizing-and-positioning-page-elements/3-pg107-adding-padding.html)

## CodeCademy's Front End Engineer Path 


## If I taught web development:

- Quick Lesson: Note takeing options with ability to run code snippets 
- Quick Lesson: run down of what a repo is and 3 commands to learn to start using it 
- Quick lesson: how to have computer read selected text, the page and turn most webpages into an easy to read format. This allows you to look away if needed to rest your eyes, helps those with learning dissabilities and helps to take notes while progressing through the reading
Quick Lesson: Where to find help and how to google something you know nothing about/ problem solving with google (maybe give a highly technical sentence and have students break down the sentence by work and figure out what it means. Do 1 to 3 examples first). Students will need to be taught where to look for help: forums, MDN docs, CSS Tricks, https://www.w3schools.com or https://devdocs.io, discord groups. 
- Quick lesson: 
- Lesson 6: 
- Using any combination of the resources listed above would be better than using one alone 
- each day's lesson should have summary activities during the lesson and after the lesson. I will summaries to key points for the students and the students will complete an "exit ticket" for sorts to summaries their learning 

### CodeCademy's Front End Engineer Path 
- CodeCademy does a few things well: The content is clearly brocken into sections and lessons. Lessons include readings, videos and active learning materials. **Major key**: Reviews or recaps of information covered is frequent within the lesson and at the end of the lesson. Two books are listed as suggested readings during the course. **Major Key**: Includes check for understanding.
- Part of lesson: Lecture/direct instruction, independent practice, optional assigned reading 
- CodeCademy has all parts of a lesson in one place and is very structured into lesson plans for the user. This is a whole classroom on the internet when completed with the suggested readings. Using Free Code Camp as a warm up would work nicely with CodeCademy and I highly suggest these two for complete beginners. The CodeCademy's Front End Engineer Path is behind a pay wall and cost upwards of $112 a year or a monthly fee to access. Though worth the money, this might not be the best option for someone on a budget. Other free resources listed above are excellent options as well for learning Front End Web development. 

### MDN Web Docs
- MDN does a few things well: The content is thorough. Detailed explanations are given throughout each lesson. Active learning is incorporated. MDN is excellent for students who want to know more and ask why. **Major Key**: Includes check for understanding.
- Part of lesson: textbook reading and independent practice 

### Free Code Camp 
- Free Code Camp does a few things well: Content is easy to start doing without any prior knowledge and no insturctor is required to complete the work. Free Code Camp would be an excellent option as a daily warmup or transition activity for a group who may finish an assignment at different times. Students will need to be taught where to look for help: FCC Forums, MDN docs, CSS Tricks, https://www.w3schools.com or https://devdocs.io. Con: full solutions can be found online
- Part of lesson: warm up 

### Web Coding & Development a book by Paul McFedries
- Web Coding & Development for Dummies does a few things well: Content is explained in a straight forward and applicable way. While no practice problems are given, this is a great textbook resource. Code snippets are provided to use in direct instruction/ teacher lead activity or to use as an example. 
- Part of lesson: textbook reading
