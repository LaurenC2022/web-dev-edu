# Front End Website Development Educational Assignments

Resources used are 

- Free Code Camp 
- MDN Web Docs
- Web Coding & Development a book by Paul McFedries
- web development course on Udemy by The London App Brewery 

Completed web page assignments are in this repo and available for viewing through [https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/]( https://laurenc2022.github.io/web-dev-edu/). 

The purpose of posting educational assignments in a repository is to reference code snippets and completed projects. I expect this repo will help with recall when I am stuck on a simple project.
