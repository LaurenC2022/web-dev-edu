This is a whole classroom on the internet when completed with the suggested readings. Using Free Code Camp as a warm up would work nicely with CodeCademy and I highly suggest these two for complete beginners. The CodeCademy's Front End Engineer Path is behind a pay wall and cost upwards of $112 a year or a monthly fee to access. Though worth the money, this might not be the best option for someone on a budget.
